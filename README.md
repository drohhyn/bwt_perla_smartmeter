# bwt_perla_smartmeter
Read throughput and volume of BWT Perla water softening system (new VNC based firmware!)
Original code by [d3monxxl](https://github.com/d3m0nxxl/bwt_perla_smartmeter), but somehow my BWT Perla has a fully different resolution so I changed most of the mouse and capture coordinates.

## requirements

python3, pip3

```bash
sudo apt install libtesseract-dev tesseract-ocr libopenjp2-7-dev
sudo pip3 install pytesseract paho-mqtt vncdotool
```
